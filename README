Running `vimdiffem` in a git repo will load up all files with changes in the
working tree, run Gdiff on the first one, and define commands Go and Gop for
viewing the diffs of the next and previous files. `vimdiffem --cached` does the
same, but examines differences between the working tree and HEAD. Careful
that you don't have changess between the index and working tree if using this!
